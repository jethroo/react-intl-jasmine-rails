# Demo Rails 5 app with react integration

This project is suppost to be a showcase of how **react** can be integrated within a modern **rails** project. The topics which are covered here are:

 * integration with I18n support
 * testing the js components with jasmine
 * acceptance test the rails view which integrate a react app

## General Dependencies

 * Rails and npm, **browserify-rails and browserify:** since we don't want to copy over every npm module we require browserify is used to include them form the node_modules folder directly (we also don't want to add the whole folder to the assets)
 * Rails and npm, **react-rails and react :** easy integration of the react framework into rails which will take care of hooking into the assets pipeline as well as provides helpers for defining the react components in the rails view files
 
## Integration with I18n support

Phrase App is a nice tool allowing different teams to collaborate in the whole translation process. The showcased react app should load json files generated via phrase app in order to provide the translated messages to the user. 

The json will be generated by utilizing the tagging mechanism of phrase app. Especially tagged keys can be synced to the rails app with the phrase app command line tool. An example configuration for your phrase app project can look like this: 

```.phraseapp.yml
phraseapp:
  access_token: <your_access_token>
  project_id: <your_project_id>
  file_format: yml
  pull:
    targets:
    - file: ./config/locales/www/<locale_name>/i18n.yml
      params:
        file_format: yml
        convert_emoji: true
    - file: ./config/locales/react/<locale_name>/i18n.json
      params:
        tag: react
        file_format: simple_json
        convert_emoji: true
```

In this project a json file for **de** and **en** is included.

### Dependencies

 * Rails, **browserify-rails:** since we don't want to copy over every npm module we require browserify is used to include them form the node_modules folder directly (we also don't want to add the whole folder to the assets)
 * npm, **intl:** an intl polyfill which is needed for some browsers and as well as for the headless browsers used in the unit and acceptance tests
 * npm, **react-intl:** an I18n framework for react
